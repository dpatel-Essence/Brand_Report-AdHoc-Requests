# BigQuery and R Studio Live Training

## Big Query

-   All projects for Advanced Analytics will be found in this schema: <https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?project=essence-analytics-dwh>

    -   Clicking (Start New Query) on this link should take you to the explorer where you can search for `essence-analytics-dwh` and make sure you pin the project to your list of projects
![Finding Project](Images/BQ1.PNG)
    -   Pinned Projects will show up under explorer and you should be able to view the various schema and tables associated with that project. There you can run and queries in editor. Save the views in BQ associated with that Query. Share query with other people and set a destination table for query if creating a permanent table. Be mindful of the amount of MBs the query will process! Very large queries can cost money.

    -   For our purposes we generally export the data provided by big query into a Domino Jupyter Notebook (not shown) or local R Studio Session.

#### Exercise 1
-   Try finding the table in the explorer in essence-analytics-dwh associated with the query:  
`SELECT * FROM` \``essence-analytics-dwh.TrueNorth_Benchmarks.social_data_2022H2`\` `where month_year >= '2022-01-01'`


```{r setup, include=TRUE}
#note: normally include = FALSE for this
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
options(knitr.table.format = "html") 
options(digits=5)
options(scipen = 100)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=80), tidy=TRUE)
#install.packages("pacman")
library(pacman) #for quick load/install of packages
p_load(
  dplyr, readr, tidyverse,forcats,purrr, # reading in data
  janitor, sqldf,googlesheets4, # additional tools for dealing with data
  skimr,
  rqdatatable, #
  splitstackshape,stringr, #string related libraries
  kableExtra, ggplot2, plotly,echarts4r,ggpubr,scales,RColorBrewer,ggthemes, #for visualization of data
  reticulate #for using python
)
```
